# WGU_C868_Capstone
This is an Android Mobile Application created for WGU C868 Capstone Class.

  The customer is Southern Senators College (SSC), a small local privately-owned college located in Southern Illinois. Its mission is to provide good quality higher education learning for local students. SSC has approximately 100 employees. Only 15% of the employees work in the administrative offices of SSC. There is an average total of 200 students enrolling every term. During recent years, they have shown an increase of student enrollment by up to 30% every term. For many years, SSC had their students retrieve a hard copy printout of their academic plan and schedule from the Registrar’s office upon enrollment. Due to the increase in student enrollment, the Registrar’s office has been struggling to keep up with manually creating an academic plan/schedule for enrolling students using an Excel spreadsheet. The manual outdated system has also caused students to miss important start and end dates of their academic plan. The current system is outdated.  SSC’s short-term goal is to upgrade this system utilizing current technology and produce the end product before the beginning of the next term. Their long-term goal is to slowly build this software product to later produce additional requirements for SSC’s daily operation.
  
  Student Tracker, an Android mobile application, is the proposed solution to SSC Registrar’s Office's ongoing dilemma. Student Tracker is a mobile app using the Android operating system where SSC’s staff and its students create an academic plan. The Student Tracker can manage the student’s academic plan by automatically tracking start and end dates of terms, courses, and assessments created by the user. The app creates notifications for the users to remind them of start and end dates. This will eliminate the problem where students are missing important academic dates. In the app, users can also add terms, add courses, and add assessments and other details associated with each one. All details will be saved in a database. This will reduce errors that were occurring with the manual system using Excel spreadsheets. The development of Student Tracker will eliminate the need for SSC’s Registrar’s office to print out a hard copy schedule for each enrolling student entirely.
  
  Student Tracker is an Android mobile application that will be developed for use by Southern Senator’s College (SSC). The app will be available for all enrolled SSC students. To ensure that a student’s data is only accessed by the student, the app will have a log-in page where students can enter their username and password. There will be three main sections to enable students to manage their academic plans effectively.
  
  The first section will allow students to add new terms and update existing term details. Students will be able to add/update terms, assign term names, and create start and end dates for the term created. They will also be able to delete terms. In this section, students can also access a generated report where they can see a list of active created terms and the date and time when the terms were added.
  
  The second section will allow students to add new courses and update existing course details. Students will be able to include the course name, start and end dates, course status, instructor name, phone, email, and course notes. Students can choose to set an alarm here so they will be notified of start and end dates, so they don’t miss these important dates. They can also choose to share notes that they added about the course via text messaging or email.
The third section will allow students to add new performance or objective types of assessments and update assessment details that are related to a course they previously added. Students will be able to include assessment names, start and end dates. They can also choose to set mobile notifications to go off and remind them of start and end dates for their assessments.
The mobile applications will utilize an industry-standard database which will enable SSC to scale the app in the future and other future integrations.
